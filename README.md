<h1 align="center"> 0x12. C - printf </h1>

<h2 align="center"> :sparkles: Collaboration with Tammy Junk :sparkles: </h2>


This is the first collaborative project in Holberton School. In this code, Tammy and I will be using printf to say "Free of CMU"  Below we will show how ``` printf ``` works.


## How to use ``` printf ```
To use the ``` printf ``` function you need to compile all of your ```.c``` files including the ```main.h```. To do so you would use:

```$ gcc *.c *.h -o```


#### Example ```main.c```:

```
#include "main.h"

int main(void)
{
    _printf("Free of CMU");
        return (0);
	}
```




#### Output:

```
$ ./test
Free of CMU
$
```
